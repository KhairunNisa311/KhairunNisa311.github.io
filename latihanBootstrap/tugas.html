            <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. 
                It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, 
                and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, 
                was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.[note 1][10][11] Since the 19th century,
                [12] "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, 
                Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[13] which largely makes up Greater London,[14] the region governed by the Greater London Authority.
                [note 2][15] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City, has for centuries held the national government and parliament.</p>

            <p>London, as one of the world's global cities,[16] exerts strong influence on its arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, 
                health care, media, tourism and communications.[17] Its GDP (â‚¬801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the biggest urban economy in Europe[18] 
                and one of the major financial centres in the world. In 2019 it had the second highest number of ultra high-net-worth individuals in Europe 
                after Paris[19] and the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe after Moscow.[20] With Europe's largest concentration 
                of higher education institutions,[21] it includes Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics 
                in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London.[22] The city is home to the most 5-star hotels of any city in the world.
                [23] In 2012, London became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games.[24]</p>
